This algorithm always starts with a single node and moves through several adjacent nodes,
in order to explore all of the connected edges along the way

How does Prim’s Algorithm Work? 

The working of Prim’s algorithm can be described by using the following steps:

    Step 1: Determine an arbitrary vertex as the starting vertex of the MST.
    Step 2: Follow steps 3 to 5 till there are vertices that are not included in the MST (known as fringe vertex).
    Step 3: Find edges connecting any tree vertex with the fringe vertices.
    Step 4: Find the minimum among these edges.
    Step 5: Add the chosen edge to the MST if it does not form any cycle.
    Step 6: Return the MST and exit
